# About this report
This report is designed with two purposes in mind. 

If read directly without opening the code chunks the report provides a comparative analysis of the State of Open Data survey 2021 published by Digital Science (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.17081231) and a community specific survey to survey the State of Open Data and attitudes towards FAIR data policies conducted by the Pigweb consortium. The Pigweb study is built on the template provided by the State of Open Data Survey to maximise the comparability between the pig research community participating in Pigweb and the much larger study conducted by Digital Science and Springer Nature. It does however also contain som specific questions regarding experiences with infrastructure and services supporting FAIR data.

Opening the code chunks provided in the document or downloading the github repository (https://github.com/SGBC/survey) enables researchers to copy the report and reuse it as a template for their own comparative studies. The document is divided into a number of code chunks with data pruning and functions at the top followed by the report with the code chunks generating data interspersed between them. The code in each chunk evaluating questions can be broken down into four parts:

1. Parsing the response tables from each questionnaire.
2. Recoding the responses from the two different surveys into the same format using functions in the file plotting_functions.R
3. Plotting response data with functions in the file plotting_functions.R.
4. Testing for statistic significance and other numeric analysis if applicable.

The code is release under a GNU General Public License v3.0 and is written to be as easily accessible as possible for students, researchers or other people who need to quickly parse and analyse a large study.

#pigw21 = pigw21[1:(length(pigw21)-6)]



#Apart from directly identifiable information it is important to ensure that combinations of information cannot be used to trace the respondents. In this case we have #therefore decided to separate the respondent data from the rest of the survey and scramble the rows. Thereby combinations such as year of first publication and major #source of finance cannot be used to identify respondents by a process of elimination. Note: This code was not used as a

#pigw21 = cbind(pigrespondents, pigw21)
#write_xlsx(pigw21, path = "pigw21s.xlsx")
#The shuffled file is the file shared in the supplementary data and loaded at the start of this chunk. 

#A problem with the surveys is that we do not have a way of knowing if an answer is a 0 or empty due to conscious lack of response by the respondent or due to the respondent not finishing the survey.

#This sets the Data Frames to start at the first question. Each code chunk take the columns corresponding to a question and pass it to the pile when done.

## Data in the survey
The questionnaire contain over 200 different answers per respondent and can be broken down into 6 different categories of questions, questions about the respondent, questions about the respondents research data, questions about the respondents usage of data and finally views on credit and recognition of data. There is also a final section on information about the respondents to the Pigweb survey which is not publicly shared as it would provide the means to identify the respondents of the survey. There are three types of questions used in the survey and shown in this report.

1. Likert scale questions, usually with a five point scale going from "I strongly disagree" to "I strongly agree". These are reported using an empirical cumulative distribution function with one line each for the State of Open Data and the Pigweb survey. Hypothesis testing with calculation of p-values is done with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with the alternate hypothesis being that respondents are drawn from two populations with different preferences
2. Single choice questions, selecting between different options the respondent select the most fitting one. A frequency bar plot with the different alternatives is used to visualize these responses.
3. Multiple choice questions, respondents may select multiple answers to the question.A frequency bar plot with the different alternatives is used to visualize these responses with the frequency being the number of respondents who selected an answer divided by the number of respondents.

## About the respondents
The first three questions of the surveys were about the first year of publication, primary area of research interest and international collaboration.

```
The proportion of respondents with over 20 years since their first publication is lower in the PigWeb survey than the State of Open Data survey but overall differences are not sufficient to rject the null hypothesis that the respondents belong to the same population(p = `r Q2KS$p.value`). As expected most PigWeb participants (N = 43) identify as Biologists (N = 28) with the remaining divided between medicine (N = 1) and "Other" where free text responses where related to veterinary sciences (N = 3), animal science (N = 6), life sciences (N = 1) or statistics and mathematics (N = 1).

Researchers participating in the PigWeb survey are to a higher degree involved in collaborations than respondents in the State of Open Data survey which is consistent with survey participants being recruited from an EU project on building infrastructure for experimental research for sustainable pig production.

Comparing the responses for each question there are no statistically significant differences between the populations(p = `r SvPQ6$p.value`, `r SvPQ7$p.value`, and `r SvPQ8$p.value` respectively). In both questionnaires respondents are however less likely to agree with the statement "Making all research outputs openly available should be common scholarly practice" than to the statement "Making research articles open access should be common scholarly practice" (p = `r SQ6vSQ8$p.value` the State of Open Data survey and `r PQ6vPQ8$p.value` for the PigWeb survey). The difference is markedly larger in the PigWeb survey as measured by the maximum geometric distance D between the two graphs (D = `r PQ6vPQ8$statistic` for Pigweb and D = `r SQ6vSQ8$statistic` for State of Open Data). We hypothesise that despite similar levels of support for open access publishing a higher proportion of the PigWeb participants are engaged in research together with commercial stakeholders which do not permit the open sharing of all data from studies made due to trade secrets and other immaterial property rights which will be followed up during a second phase of the PigWeb project with qualitative interviews. Researchers in PigWeb are also to a large degree of the existence of FAIR data as a concept but unfamiliar with applying it in practice.

```
In comparison with the State of Open Data survey participants are more likely to be aware of FAIR data policies but lacking in familiarity with them (p = `r SvPQ9$p.value` and D = `r SvPQ9$p.statistic`).

## Implementation of FAIR data sharing in PigWeb
These questions are unique to the PigWeb survey and included as the European Commission policy is to promote and support FAIR data. In many cases FAIR data is also open data but in many sectors collaborations, immaterial rights and other requirements limit the ability to openly share all data and the PigWeb survey therefore include current work on FAIR data as supported by the EU commission and many national research organisations as well as the questions used in the State of Open Data survey.

Researchers show the highest degree of uncertainty regarding FAIR policies on a national level (`r Q10_data[2,5]` %) but overall roughly a third of the respondents report that there is a FAIR data policy in place and they are aware of it. This is significantly lower than the percentage of researchers reporting that they are familiar with FAIR in the PigWeb survey (17 %, displayed in figure 8) but lower than the number of researchers reporting that they are aware of FAIR (71 %, displayed in figure 8). A small number of researchers also report that they confidently state that there is no FAIR policy in place at the university (14 %, N = 6) or enforced by their main funder (10 %, N = 4).
