# Survey README
This repository contains an R Markdown code for quickly performing comparisons between the State of Open Data survey 2021 and similar surveys.
The Markdown book generates a report comparing the State of Open Data survey 2021 with the Pigweb community survey which was built on the same survey but with some
extra questions specific for the community. The report can be used both as a description of the similarities and differences among respondents to the two surveys and
as a template with code to add further surveys to the dataset. The repository currently contain the following files:

* opendatasurvey.Rmd The R markdown code or the report
* PigWebSurvey.pdf, the pigweb Survey conducted using the Netigate survey tool.
* Responsetypes.xlsx, a small number of examples of how the answers are stored in excel.
* StateOfOpenDataSurvey.docx the State of Open Data Survey questionnaire 2021 kindly provided by the SoD team (https://digitalscience.figshare.com/articles/report/The_State_of_Open_Data_2021/17061347)
* pigw21.xlsx the responses from the Pigweb survey analysed in the markdown report.
* sod21.xlsx the response from the State of Open Data survey
* survey.Rproj the r Proje file.

Anyone wishing to contribute to the analysis of the data is warmly welcome to alter the code and propose changes. For the addition of additional surveys we can easily create a new fork to accomodate this.


The PIGWEB project has received funding from European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under Grant Agreement No 101004770.
